Children's Story Poem, The Twelve Goblin Brothers
						Yun Sŏk-chung

The night we moved into the new house.
The night it rained and the wind blew and thunder crashed.
The night goblins came out from the back mountain, the back mountain,
And threw stones onto our house's roof.

Closing the shutters, pulling the blanket over us,
Mommy and I sat facing each other, shivering, trembling,
Just as we were about to fall asleep, about to fall asleep, again,
Tang Tang Ttegurruru—Tung!
Even covering my ears and closing my eyes, <68>
Tang Tang Ttegurruru—Tung!

The next morning,
When I went to the back mountain, the back mountain,
Rotten peaches from the peach tree
Had been blown off by the wind,
Hitting the tin roof with a Tang Tang,
Then rolling down Ttegurruru to the ground, Tung!
That's why all night long it was
Tang Tang Ttegurruru—Tung...

I went down and counted them, twelve in all!
I put those twelve peaches in a net bag
And carried it around the village showing everyone.
To the village people who used to sit huddled inside,
Too scared of goblins to budge on rainy nights,
I showed them the twelve goblin brothers I had caught.
After that, after that,
All the cowards in our village disappeared.
Min Saengwŏn from across the stream, Hŏ Sŏndal from over the ridge,
Now they swagger around even on pitch-black nights.

**Summary**

This children's poem by Yun Sŏk-chung tells the story of a child initially frightened by strange noises on a stormy night, believed to be goblins throwing stones on the roof. The next day, the child discovers the source was merely rotten peaches falling onto the tin roof. By collecting the "twelve goblin brothers" (the peaches) and showing them to the fearful villagers, the child dispels their superstitions, leading to newfound bravery in the community. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as a piece of children's literature from the colonial period that promotes rational explanation over traditional folklore or superstition (fear of goblins). It reflects a potentially modernizing or enlightenment influence, encouraging observation and demystification, even within a simple children's tale set in a rural Korean village. The naming conventions (Saengwŏn, Sŏndal) also offer a glimpse into social titles of the time.

童話詩, 도깨비 열두형제
						尹石重
새 집으로 이사 온 밤.
비 오고 바람 불고 천둥 하던 밤.
뒷 산에 뒷 산에 도깨비가 나와,
우리 집 집웅에 돌 팔매 질 하던 밤.

덧 문을 닫고 이불을 쓰고,
엄마하고 나하고 마조 앉어, 덜덜 떨다가,
잘랴고 잘랴고 마악 들어누면, 또,
탕 탕 떼구루루-퉁!
귀를 막고 눈을 감고 그래도,＜68＞
탕 탕 떼구루루-퉁!

이틋 날 아츰,
뒷 산에 뒷 산에 가 보니깐,
복숭아 나무 썩은 열매가
바람에 불려 떠러저서,
탕 탕 생철 집웅을 치고는,
떼구루루 굴러 내려 땅으로 퉁!
그래서 밤 새도록
탕 탕 떼구루루-퉁...

내려가 세보니깐 모두 열두개!
그 복숭아 열두개를 망태에 담아
동네 방네로 메고 다니며 구경시켯죠.
비 오는 밤이면은 도깨비가 무서워
꿈쩍 못하고 들어 앉엇던 동네 사람들한테
내가 잡은 도깨비 열두형제를 끄내보엿죠.
그 뒤로는 그 뒤로는,
우리 마을 겁쟁이 다 없어젓서요.
물 건너 민생원, 등 넘어 허 선달,
이젠 캄캄한 밤이라도 막 뽑내구 다니죠.
