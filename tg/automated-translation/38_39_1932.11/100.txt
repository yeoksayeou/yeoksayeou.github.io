Monthly Scene

**Emergence of Writers from Ewha**
Following the recent boom in the magazine world, many new female writers are emerging, and among them, graduates from Ewha Womans College (梨花專門), Chosŏn's only women's college, are coming to the fore. These include the female poet Mo Yun-suk (毛允淑); Kim Cha-hye (金慈惠), a reporter for "Shintōa" (新東亞); Son Ch'o-ak (孫楚岳), who was briefly with "P'ip'an" (批判); Hong Hye-do (洪惠道), Cho Hyŏn-gyŏng (趙賢景), Pak Ŭn-hye (朴恩惠), Ch'oe I-kwŏn (崔以權), and Chu Su-wŏn (朱壽元), who formed the writing team for "Yŏron" (女論); and Pak Kil-lae (朴吉來), who was briefly associated with "Tonggwang" (東光). In addition to these Ewha graduates, the writings of Kim Yŏng-ŭi (金英義) and No Tae-myŏng (盧大命) are also occasionally seen, truly making for a gathering of many talents (多士濟濟). We hope that truly outstanding writers will emerge from among them.

**Mr. Kim Ki-jŏn's Illness**
Mr. Kim Ki-jŏn (金起田), sobriquet Soch'un (小春), former head of the Ch'ŏndogyo Youth Party (天道敎靑年黨), current advisor to the Ch'ŏngudang (靑友黨), a heavyweight of the Ch'ŏndogyo New Faction (天道敎 新派), and a fighter for the same new group, was recuperating from a lung ailment in the Kŭmgang Mountains (金剛山). However, his condition did not improve, and in September, he returned to Kyŏngsŏng (京城) and was admitted to the Medical College Hospital (醫專病院). The trust and expectations placed in him extend beyond the confines of the church, and thus we eagerly await the day of his swift recovery.

**Cho Pong-am Arrested**
Cho Pong-am (曺奉岩), one of the founders of the Chosŏn Communist Youth League (朝鮮共産黨靑年會) and a cadre of the Communist Party (共産黨), is said to have been arrested (被促) in Shanghai Park and will soon be escorted back to Chosŏn. Cho Pong-am was born in Kanghwa (江華) and worked at the county office. He participated in the Manse Incident (萬歲事件) in the Kimi year (己未年, 1919), and later, his participation as a representative when the first Communist Party congress for Chosŏn was held in Irkutsk (일크추크) is said to have been his first step into the communist movement. This Irkutsk Congress was the very meeting that caused the split between the Irkutsk Faction (伊市派) and the Shanghai Faction (上海派), and since then, he has been identified as a member of the Irkutsk Faction. Afterwards, he studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East (勞働大學) in Irkutsk, secretly entered Chosŏn, became a member of the Tuesday Society (火曜會) and a promoter of the Sinhŭng Youth Alliance (新興靑年同盟), and then, at the time of the first founding of the Communist Party, became a founder and cadre of the Communist Youth League along with Im Wŏn-gŭn (林元根) and Kim Tan-ya (金丹冶). Later, he went to Moscow (莫斯科) with Cho Tong-u (趙東祐) to seek Party recognition, but as the secret organization was discovered in Chosŏn and all cadres were arrested, he was forced to live abroad. In Shanghai, he used the alias Pak Ch'ŏl-hwan (朴鐵煥), lived with his beloved wife before separating, and later married a new wife, an Ewha graduate, with whom he remains to this day. It is said that his elderly mother, younger sister, and one child he had back home all passed away years ago, which truly exemplifies the tragedy of life in exile.

**Mr. Han Ki-ak's Hospitalization**
Mr. Han Ki-ak (韓基岳), sobriquet Wŏlpong (月峰), former Executive Director and long-time Editor-in-Chief of the Chosun Ilbo (朝鮮日報), is reportedly hospitalized and undergoing treatment at Hyŏphwa Hospital (協和病院) for extreme nervous exhaustion. This is perhaps due to the excessive strain from leading the employees' association in a solitary struggle (孤軍奮鬪) over the newspaper's copyright issue. Many sympathize, wondering how much the normally gentle Mr. Han must have agonized over the complex problem to reach such a state. <20>

**Summary**

This "Monthly Scene" article from November 1932 reports on several notable figures. It highlights the increasing number of female writers emerging from Ewha Womans College, listing prominent names like Mo Yun-suk and Kim Cha-hye. It also updates readers on the health of Kim Ki-jŏn, a key figure in the Ch'ŏndogyo New Faction, who is hospitalized for a lung ailment. A significant portion details the arrest of communist leader Cho Pong-am in Shanghai and his impending transfer to Korea, recounting his background in the communist movement, his association with the Irkutsk faction, and personal tragedies faced in exile. Finally, it notes the hospitalization of Han Ki-ak, former Chosun Ilbo executive, due to stress from newspaper-related conflicts. For historians, this article offers valuable insight into the burgeoning female intellectual scene connected to Ewha, the internal dynamics and key figures within the Ch'ŏndogyo religion's factions, the activities and suppression of early Korean communists like Cho Pong-am (including factional splits and ties to Moscow/Irkutsk), and the pressures faced by Korean journalists and media outlets under colonial rule.

梨花의 文人輩出
最近 雜誌界의 活況을 따라 女人文筆家가 많이 새로 나는 中에 朝鮮의 唯一한 女子專門學校인 梨花專門 出身이 擡頭하는 現狀이 잇다. 女流詩人 毛允淑 氏를 비롯하야 「新東亞」 記者 金慈惠 氏  「批判」에 暫間 잇든 孫楚岳 氏 「女論」을 筆陣으로 한 洪惠道, 趙賢景, 朴恩惠, 崔以權, 朱壽元 等 諸氏며 「東光」과 暫間 因緣지엇든 朴吉來 氏 等이다. 梨專出身이며 그 外에 金英義
盧大命 氏 等의 글도 散見하니 實로 多士濟濟하다 하겟거니와 그 中에서 참으로 出衆한 作家가 많이 나오기를 바란다.

金起田君의 病勢
前 天道敎靑年黨 黨頭요 現在 靑友黨顧問으로 잇어 天道敎 新派의 重鎭이요 同新人의 鬪士라 할 小春 金起田 氏는 肺患으로 金剛山에 靜養中이더니 病勢가 덜리지 아니하야 9월에는 京城으로 돌아와 醫專病院에 入院을 하얏다. 君에게 대한 信望과 期待는 敎會範圍를 超越하느니만큼 快差할 날이 쉬 오기를 苦待한다.

曺奉岩被促
朝鮮共産黨靑年會 創立者의 한사람이요 共産黨의 幹部의 하나인 曺奉岩이 上海公園에서 被促하야 不日 朝鮮으로 護送된다고 한다. 曺奉岩은 江華出生으로 郡廳에 勤務하다가 己未年에 萬歲事件에 參加하엿다가 일크추크에서 朝鮮으로 最初의 共産黨大會가 열릴때에 代表로 參加한 것이 그가 共産運動에 加入한 첫거름이엇섯다 한다. 이 일크츠크大會는 곳 伊市派와 上海派를 分立케 한 大會로 以來 그는 伊市派의 한사람으로 指稱되엇다. 其後 伊市의 勞働大學을 修學하고 朝鮮에 潛入하야 火曜會會員, 新興靑年同盟 發起人이 되고 다시 第1次 共産黨創立當時에 林元根, 金丹冶 等과 함께 共産靑年會의 創立者兼幹部가 되엇다. 그후 黨의 承認을 받기 위하야 趙東祐와 함께 莫斯科로 갓다가 朝鮮에서 秘密結社가 發見되고 幹部가 다 被促하므로 눌러 海外生活을 하게 되엇다. 上海에서는 變名을 朴鐵煥이라 하엿고 愛妻와 同棲하다가 離別하고 그후에 梨專出身인 新妻를 迎하야 지금에 이르럿다 한다.
故鄕에는 老母와 누이동생 及 所生 一人이 잇엇는데 年前에 俱沒하얏다는 것은 亡命生活의 悲劇을 如實히 맛본 것이라 하겟다.

韓基岳君의 入院
前 朝鮮日報專務理事요 編輯局長으로 오래 잇든 月峰 韓基岳君은 同報가 版權問題로 社員會를 이끌고 孤軍奮鬪에 너무 시달린 까닭인지 極度의 神經衰弱으로 目下 協和病院에 入院 治療中이라고 한다. 元來가 溫和한 氏가 複雜한 問題를 가지고 얼마나 머리를 썩히엇기에 거기까지 이르럿는가 하야 同情하는 사람이 많다. ＜20＞
