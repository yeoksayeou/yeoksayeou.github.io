Cartoon, Latest Fashion Clothing Scene
Art by Yi Ch'an-yŏng

With a fur *satkat* (traditional conical hat), a parasol is absolutely useless. The extra accessory (덧굴네) on the back would make even a Japanese samurai flinch, and the awl-like shoe heels would give even a Chinese grandmother goosebumps. Let alone the dirt on the skirt! If this and that are all wrong, please at least look at the hand gestures!

Modern Girl Student. The skirt is short, but the shoes are big, you see. They're said to be sportsman shoes. The soles are "crepe" (그리푸), so they don't make a sound (like *sappŭn sippŭn*) when walking, you see.<15>

**Summary**

This cartoon by Yi Ch'an-yŏng from 1932 satirizes the "latest fashion" trends among Korean women, particularly the "Modern Girl." It humorously critiques the awkward combination of traditional Korean items (fur hat) with Western/modern elements (parasol, high heels, short skirts, crepe-soled sports shoes), suggesting their impracticality and questionable aesthetics by comparing the reaction they might elicit from Japanese samurai or Chinese grandmothers. The commentary highlights perceived flaws like dirty skirts and large shoes, ultimately asking the viewer to appreciate the wearer's posture or gestures if the outfit itself fails. From a historical perspective, this piece offers insight into the cultural anxieties and social commentary surrounding rapid Westernization and changing gender roles in colonial Korea. It reflects the negotiation of identity as traditional and modern elements clashed, particularly in the visible sphere of women's fashion, making it valuable for historians studying modernity, cultural change, and perceptions of the "Modern Girl" archetype during this period.

						李燦英 畫
제털 삿갓에 파라솔은 斷然無用. 잔등의 덧굴네는 日本사무라이도 음질이 갈것이며 송곳같은 구두뒤축은 中國할머니도 소름이 끼칠 것이다. 于況 스커트의 흙쯤이야! 이도 저도 다 틀리거든 손낄만이라도 보아 주세요!
모던 女學生. 치마는 짧지만 구두는 크지오. 스포츠맨 슈즈랍니다. 구두창은 「그리푸」이기에 다닐 때 (사쁜 시쁜) 소리도 안나지오.＜15＞
