Correction

Correction: The "Poem Dawn Sky," published in last month's issue, is hereby fully retracted at the request of the author, Son Chŏnghwa. <115>

**Summary**

This brief notice announces the complete retraction of a poem titled "Dawn Sky" by Son Chŏnghwa, which appeared in the previous issue of the *Tonggwang* magazine. The retraction was made at the author's request. This small editorial note is interesting for historians as it hints at potential authorial dissatisfaction, editorial disagreements, or perhaps external pressures that could lead to the withdrawal of published work, even poetry, during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects the magazine's mechanism for corrections and retractions.
